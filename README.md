## About SKITER
Skiter is a social media platform inspired by Twitter and Instagram, built by me and a classmate. During the project, my focus was on the front and back-end development, specifically designing and implementing the visual aspects, and building functionalities like uploading images or giving feedback on posts.


### Why did we use Laravel

We decided to use Laravel because we wanted to learn a new back-end framework. Since both of us were familiar with writing PHP code, we searched for a PHP framework on Google, and Laravel seemed to be the best choice for us.


### Why did we use TailwindCSS

We were deciding which CSS framework to use. We had the choice of Bootstrap, but it limits us in what we wanted to create. So, we opted for TailwindCSS because it gives us more freedom to create our own theme and classes.

## Lessons learned

* #### Prioritize user experience 
###### Focus on creating an intuitive and enjoyable platform.

* #### Image upload system
###### While constructing the image uploading system, we discovered that it was actually easier than we initially thought. We were able to complete this function much faster than we had anticipated, which gave us extra time to concentrate on other aspects of the application.

* #### Like posts system
###### While we were working on building the system for liking posts, we realized that it was much more difficult than we initially thought. However, we were able to overcome this challenge by using the internet to find information and asking people online or in person for help. With their assistance, we eventually managed to make the system work.
